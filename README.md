## Project Name: Order Tracker Queue
User enters the name, item and adress of the person reveiving an order, the information is then stored in a queue data structure. Users can add orders to the queue, view the next order, and delete the order. The program is similar to something that may be used when tracking orders and deliveries. The order comes in and is added to the queue, after the order is sent out it is removed from the queue.
