# order_tracker_queue
- the user first selects the maximum size of their queue
- they can then add orders to the queue, view the next order, and delete the order
- when adding an order the user is asked to input the name, item, and address of the person receiving
- the program is similar to something that may be used when tracking orders and deliveries. The order comes in and is added to the queue, after the order is sent out it is removed from the queue.
